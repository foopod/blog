description: In 2024 I was inspired to start writing a novella
---

After reading a few particularly good books I felt inspired to start writing a book of my own. And I went down one heck of a rabbit-hole.

From reading every post on [r/writing](https://reddit.com/r/writing) to buying distraction-free writing devices to doing daily exercises out of Ursula K. Le Guin's "Steering The Craft" - I was in deep.

A short outline had been manifesting in my mind over the last few months and you know the phrase "everyone has a book inside them", well I looked it up (just now, while writing this) and the first results were...

> "Everybody does have a book in them, but in most cases that's where it should stay."
>
> ~ Chris Hitchens

and...

> “It’s probably true that everyone has a book in them, although it may not be a very good one.”
>
> ~ Wilbur Smith

Hmmm... maybe I should have done some more research.

At first the words flowed, but after the first few thousand it was like pulling teeth. And worse yet, when I went to edit parts I had already written - it was some of the most boring stuff I have ever read. It turns out I write a bit like a scientific observer, dictating what physically happens in each scene. Not only is it not motivating or moving - it sucks, its hard to read.

So here I am, 30,000 odd words in, wondering where to from here. With most new hobbies, I tend to take advantage of the Dunning Kruger effect - bailing before things go downhill. But writing hasn't seemed to to follow the same trajectory as most things, I never felt confident in anything I have produced.

I even went as far as making a [website](https://baugi.jonoshields.com) to get feedback from people. 

Perhaps with a small break and some more practice things will improve.
